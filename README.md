##ruby_prism_cucumber##

###About###
This is a starter set for a software test automation project using [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [site_prism](https://github.com/natritmeyer/site_prism), [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/ruby), and [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara).  *Site_prism* implements a *PageObject* framework that is more sophisticated than that supplied by the *page-object* gem. With *site_prism* you can break a page up into sections and share common sections across pages. Cucumber supports [Behavior Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development#Principles_of_BDD).  Cucumber **Features** map to **user stories** and group **Scenarios** which consist of **Given**, **When**, and **Then** statemensts.  Capaybara provides a higher level API that reduces the coding effort when compared to base selenium (which in this framework Capybara is using under the covers).
